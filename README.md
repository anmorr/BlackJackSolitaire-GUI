# BlackJackSolitaire-GUI
This is a GUI version of Black Jack Solitaire

The following instructions below describe how to play the Blackjack Solitaire GUI game:

1. Start the program within Eclipse using the BlackjackSolitaireRunner.java

2. The GUI should have opened up.

3. The left side of the GUI interface has a button that shows the Current Card that the user can
   choose to place either on the board, or in the Discarded Spots section. Use your mouse to click
   the desired spot for the current card. You cannot pick the same spot twice. This holds true for 
   the discarded spots and the game board.
   
 4. When all the game board spots, 1-16, have been used, the game will calculate the total and present the final
    score at the top of the window.
